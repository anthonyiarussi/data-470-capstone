    "#### This data set allows exploration of how different variables impact defaulting on credit card payments. We will look at individual interactions of these variables, as well as using machine learning to predict the probability of an individual defaulting on their credit card payments. This is an important issue today, that companies have turned to data science to help solve. From this data set we will model high risk user characteristics and credit card payment history. As this model includes longitudinal data, it can be used as a tool to assess risk in real time. Unlike credit scores the model will also take into account important personal characteristics such as age, gender, marital status and education level. The problem of assessing credit risk is decades old. Due to the influx of credit card users in many countries, it has become necessary to use all means to assess risk in individuals. "
